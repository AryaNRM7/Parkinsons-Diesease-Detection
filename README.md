# Parkinsons-Diesease-Detection
Parkinson's Disease is a fatal disease that causes brain damage and paralysis.
This project deals with machine learning models which help in the detection of Parkinson's disease. 
We have used three machine-learning models
1. Naive-Bayes classifier
2. Decision Tree
3. K-Nearest Neighbour classifier.

This allows us to identify the presence of Parkinson's Disease with an accuracy of nearly 80%.
